#App Features:
- Add a task with the date it was added.
- select when adding the task if the task is completed or incomplete.
- checkbox to toggle between task complete or incomplete after adding the task.
- edit the task and select if the task is completed or incomplete.
- delete the task.
- Clear all tasks
- filter completed and incomplete tasks | or get all tasks.
- valid forms.

#App Optimization:
- I used React.memo() With useCallback() hook for preventing unnecessary re-render and re-executed for components.
- I used React Portals for modals on the entire page
